As time strives by, some tragic errors were found by the author; while not having an horrific impact on the key conclusions, they're still extremly annoying, therefore a short list of them is given below, which may
(hopefully not) be expanded in the future:

p. 28 first line: at the very end of the line a factor 2 is too many
p. 77 second last line: instead of  [-1.3 pi, 1.3 pi], [-0.65 pi, 0.65 pi] is meant
